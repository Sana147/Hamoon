                </h1>                
                <h4><p>Pakistan is in the midst of a digital revolution that is transforming the way citizens interact with government and private services. Mobile apps—once used by only the few—are now an integral part of daily life for millions throughout the country. These apps make essential services more accessible and efficient by streamlining tasks, such as updating national identity documents and managing telecom accounts. As a result, many Pakistanis find themselves increasingly reliant on local apps to handle everyday tasks and fulfill work-related responsibilities.</p> 

<p>Unfortunately, however, many of these apps are riddled with security vulnerabilities and hidden backdoors that can easily expose personal information. Within the country’s surveillance-based software development ecosystem, opportunities for exploitation abound—making apps susceptible to targeted attacks that put users at risk.</p>

<p> Within this context, Pakistani citizens face threats from three primary categories of attackers: state actors, non-state actors, and hybrid actors. These groups target individuals based on factors such as political views, activism, religious beliefs, and involvement in exposing illegal activities. Threats from these attackers put the personal safety and privacy of at-risk users at significant risk. We examine the three types of attackers, below. </p> </h4>
                <h3>
                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Three types of Attackers:</span>
                </h3>

                <h3>
                    <span class="font-weight-bold">(1) State Actors</span>
                </h3>
                <h4><p>State actors primarily include law enforcement agencies, local police, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). In recent years, these actors have been accused of using advanced surveillance tools to monitor and control citizens. For instance, during the protests following the allegations of electoral rigging in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/17/pakistan-official-admits-involvement-in-rigging-election-results" target="blank" rel="nooperner noreferrer">February 08, 2024 elections</a> elections, it is believed that law enforcement used geo-fencing and geo-tagging technology to track the movements of at-risk individuals participating in the protests. By cross-referencing this geo-location data with records from the National Database and Registration Authority, local police were able to identify and make arbitrary arrests of individuals deemed to be suspicious—regardless of their involvement in the protests. Developments such as these highlight the growing concern over state surveillance and its use for political control and suppression of dissent in Pakistan.</p>
                </h4>
                <h3>
                    <span class="font-weight-bold">(2) Non-State Actors</span>
                </h3>
                <h4><p>Non-state actors in this context include a wide range of private individuals and groups, such as religious extremists, local drug cartels, and criminal organizations. These actors typically target individuals based on their religion, political views, or involvement in activities that threaten the interests of the non-state actors. For example, journalists and activists who cover stories about religious intolerance or illegal activities are often at risk of being targeted.</p>
                
                <p>A tragic incident that underscores the threat posed by non-state actors occurred on <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2023/02/frankensteins-monster-the-growing-ttp-threat-in-pakistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 30, 2023, suicide bombing</a> when a suicide bombing claimed numerous lives and struck fear into local communities. Attacks like these, carried out by extremist factions or criminal organizations, highlight the vulnerability of individuals who challenge the status quo—whether through reporting, activism, or participation in peaceful protests.</p>
                </h4>
                <h3>
                    <span class="font-weight-bold">(3) Hybrid Actors</span>
                </h3>
                <h4><p>Hybrid actors represent a particularly insidious threat to citizens in Pakistan. Within the particular context of this project, these actors are typically corrupt government officials who abuse their positions of power to gain access to sensitive personal data. By leveraging state resources, they can obtain personal records of at-risk individuals, such as journalists, human rights defenders, or activists. These officials may then share this information with criminal groups or other malicious actors who seek to intimidate, monitor, or harm these individuals.</p>
                <p>Collaboration between corrupt officials and criminal organizations creates a dangerous environment in which sensitive personal data is used not only for surveillance, but for targeting vulnerable individuals. In this manner, the risks faced by those who expose government wrongdoing, advocate for social change, or report on sensitive issues are amplified.</p></h4>
                <h2>
                    <span class="font-weight-bold">At-Risk Individuals</span>
                </h2>
                <h4><p>Individuals whose work challenges the status quo or exposes instances of corruption, human rights violations, or illegal activities are most vulnerable to threats from the groups of attackers described above. These individuals include journalists, activists, and human rights defenders, as well as protesters—particularly when they engage in rallies or demonstrations that criticize government policies or actions. Threats faced include physical harm, harassment, intimidation, and unlawful detention. As these individuals advocate for justice, transparency, and accountability, they often become targets of both state and non-state actors—putting their safety and freedom at severe risk. Victims of domestic abuse also find themselves at risk, as they face ongoing threats from abusers within their home.</p>
                
<p>The convergence of state, non-state, and hybrid actors complicates the degree and range of threats faced by Pakistani citizens. Individuals who engage in activism, journalism, or protests often find themselves vulnerable to surveillance, harassment, and violence—highlighting the urgent need for stronger protections for those at the frontlines of social change and justice.</p>
